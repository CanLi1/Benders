in this folder we implement lagrangean decomposition
algorithm
we apply two heuristics
1.take the weighted sum average the lagrangean subproblem. then round the first stage decisions to the nearest integer. the capacity
which is continous is taken as weighted sum average if the corresponding binary variable is nonzero
otherwise the capacity is taken as zero
2.take the weighted average for all the variables then choose the scenario that is closest to this solution. using 2-norm distanc
