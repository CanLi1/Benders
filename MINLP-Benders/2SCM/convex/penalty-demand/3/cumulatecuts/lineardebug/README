try to debug using the linearized version of the problem
basically, using underestimators for the -log function.
the cuts are generated according to mustafa's paper
it seems that the infnorm works better
we also tried both rank1 cuts and higher rank cuts
also we try to cluster all the benders cut by scenarios but it works bad
