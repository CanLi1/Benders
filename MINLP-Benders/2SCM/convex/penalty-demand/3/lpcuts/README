In this folder we have the problem with nonlinear lift-and-project cuts
However sometimes the NLP solver cannot solve the sep problem or lpsub problem even though the problems
are convex. Therefore for these two types of problem, we will check the modelstat after the problems are
solved. If the modelstat!=1,2 we will not add the corresponding cut.
we have tried solvers including conopt conopt4 ipopt, but they tend to return very different results
for ipopt, it has very weird behavior, the gap closed are either<0 or >>1 which doesn't make sense.
in the end we used conopt because it return good Lagrangean bound and make more sense for the gap closed
