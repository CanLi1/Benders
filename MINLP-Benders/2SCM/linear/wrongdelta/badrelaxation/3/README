we find that the number of constraints in the master problem do have an influence on the algorithm. Now we will not activate the constraints
whose iteration index is greater than the current iteration. But if we activate all the constraints in all iterations,
it will have a different result. I think it is due to the fact that there are multiple optimal solution for the benders master problem
the solution it choose has an influence on the upper bound of the problem and thus on the way we update the multiplers of the lagrangean proble
