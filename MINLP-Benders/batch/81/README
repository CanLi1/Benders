here we assume each demand can have high low medium
there are combination for the first three products 
there are not combination for the last two products
we test new formulation Njws <= NjF
which has a much tighter NLP relaxtion than the previous constaint
used
so we change to this new formulation thereafter in cross.gms
we only run cross.gms and cross1.gms
the others are still in the old formulation
the best result is in cross1 and cross
