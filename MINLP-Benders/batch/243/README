We have tested the cross decomposition with differnce parameters for theta0 and half0. The theta=2 half=0.8 have best result
diffrent initialization has influene on the performance of the nlp solver. Sometimes even though we know that the nlp
is feasible. CONOPT can converge to an infeasible point
Ignacio gives two suggestions
1. try to resolve the nlp if the modelstat of gams is infeasible
2. try to rescale the variable
