in this folder we implement the benchmark with lagrangean decomposition and
progressive hedging
the upper bound heuristic of lagrangean decomposition is "nearest scenario"
the upper bound procedure of ph is the same
the selection of parameter rho in ph is based on the heuristic of Watson and Woodruff "progressive 
hedging innovations for a class of stochastic mixed-integer resource allocation problems"
